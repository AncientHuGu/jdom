Items that need to be done:

--- FOR JDOM BETA5 ---

* Make JDK 1.1 builds work for jdom-contrib and jdom-test

* Automate build process, using ant tasks to EOL handling
  Consider .zip readable by JAR
  Consider releasing source with jdom.jar as sole distribution
  Write todos/tounix tasks (Alex Chaffee?)

* Fix namespaces to handle disparate prefixes to same URI
  (Make them unique by prefix/URI)

* Consider changing XMLOutputter to have more set methods like Enhydra's
  DOMFormatter.  Possible good ones:
   void setIndenting(boolean enable) 
                       Enable or disable indentation.
   void setIndentSize(int size) 
                       Set indentation size.
   void setJavaEncoding(java.lang.String newJavaEncoding) 
                       Set the encoding using the Java encoding name.
   void setLineWidth(int width) 
                       Set the width at while long lines are split 
                       when indentation is enabled.
   void setOmitEncoding(boolean omit) 
                       Set flag indicating if encoding should be 
                       omitted from the XML header.  Helps some WAP clients.
   void setPreserveSpace(boolean preserve) 
                       Set the default space-preservation flag.
   void setXmlEncoding(java.lang.String newXmlEncoding) 
                       Set the encoding using the XML encoding name.
   void setXmlEncoding(java.lang.String newJavaEncoding,
                       java.lang.String newXmlEncoding) 
                       Set both the XML and Java encodings.
   void setLineSeparator(String lineSeparator)

* Finalize the license text we'll use for release.  Update all source files to
  match most current license in jdom/LICENSE.txt.  
  See http://www.zope.org/Resources/ZPL point #3 for one approach to 
  attribution.

* Ensure EOL is \r\n by default, but settable to be platform specific if need
  be.  Add justification to the FAQ.

* Add methods/logic to Verifier for all XML spec. constraints

* Consider changing the Verifier method signatures to throw the
  IllegalXXXException directly instead of returning null on error,
  and let the caller pass the exception through

--- FOR JDOM 1.0 ---

* Have Jools populate jdom-test

* Implement SAXOutputter

* Implement inline entities:
        <?xml version='1.0' ?>
        <!DOCTYPE mydtd[
        <!ENTITY nbsp '&#160;'>
        <!ENTITY aring '&#229;'>
        <!ENTITY auml '&#228;'>
        <!ENTITY ouml '&#246;'>
        <!ENTITY Aring '&#197;'>
        <!ENTITY Auml '&#196;'>
        <!ENTITY Ouml '&#214;'>]>

        <DOCUMENT>
                God forts&auml;ttning p&aring; det nya millenniet!
        </DOCUMENT>

* Finalize how regular entities are to work

* Consider SAXBuilder.setErrorHandler()

* Consider SAXBuilder.setIgnoreingWhitespace() and similar
  Should save lots of memory.

* Writing a "Getting started" guide for newbies 
  (Tom Clements <clements@eng.sun.com>)

* Add JAXP 1.1 supporting classes when it's ready.  Design them to follow the
  JAXP model so they are usable without JAXP, and can be trivially made to
  work with JAXP.

--- FOR JDOM 1.1 ---

* Add XPath support
  Much work being done by Michael Hinchey <michael.hinchey@inference.com>

* Figure out XPath interface, current best is this:
    List    XPath.getList(Element e, String xpath)  // or Document param
    Comment XPath.getComment(Element e, String xpath)
    Element XPath.getElement(Element e, String xpath)
    ProcIns XPath.getProcIns(Element e, String xpath)
    Entity  XPath.getEntity(Element e, String xpath)
    String  XPath.getText(Element e, String xpath)

* Eliminate string hardcoding.  Use resource bundles to allow for
  localization.

* Investigate a way to do in-memory validation.  First step is probably 
  to get an in-memory representation of a DTD as per
  http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=626

--- UNTIED TO A JDOM VERSION ---

* Contribute the samples from Elliotte's XML DevCon talk to the samples/
  directory.  http://metalab.unc.edu/xml/slides/xmlsig/jdom/JDOM.html

* Add search for jdom.org using Google with site:www.jdom.org, imitating
  http://www.zope.org/SiteIndex/searchForm

* Fix it so check-in messages include diffs.  (jools@jools.org)  Use
  archive to create an accurate CHANGELOG.txt for what changed between betas.

* Add ElementLocator to contrib/ directory (from Alfred Lopez)

* Figure out if we need to support maintaining CDATA sections

* Put www.jdom.org content under CVS

* Write a guide for contributors
    Follow Sun's coding guidelines, use 4-space (no tab) indents, no lines
    longer than 80 characters

* Look at putting XML files in the jdom.jar META-INF directory for things like
  version, credits, description, etc, then access/print the info using JDOM
  classes executed by a "java -jar jdom.jar" command.  
  See http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar/

* Investigate including a library to convert XML data to instantiated Java
  objects, probably with an XML config file dictating how to do the mapping.
  See http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=674 for something along these lines.
