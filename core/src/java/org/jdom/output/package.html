Classes to output JDOM documents to various destinations.  The most
common outputter class is XMLOutputter which outputs a document as a stream of
bytes.  SAXOutputter lets you output as a stream of SAX events (handy
especially in transformations) and DOMOutputter lets you output as a DOM tree.
JDOMLocator helps observe the SAX output process.
