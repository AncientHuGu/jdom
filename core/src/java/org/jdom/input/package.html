Classes to build JDOM documents from various sources.  The most common
builder class is SAXBuilder which constructs a JDOM document can build from
files, streams, sockets, readers, and so on by using an underlying third party
SAX parser to handle the parsing chores.  DOMBuilder lets you build from a
pre-existing DOM tree.  The JDOMFactory interface provides advanced users with
the ability to create subtypes of the org.jdom classes.
