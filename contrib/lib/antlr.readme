ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a
language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
C++ or Java actions.  It was written by Terrence Parr, who generously
put it in the public domain.  See http://www.antlr.org/ for more
information.
