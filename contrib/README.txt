Introduction
============

jdom-contrib is a place for projects that increase the value of JDOM but
aren't (at least yet) in the core distribution.  Contributors with write
access to jdom-contrib can be found in COMMITTERS.txt.  Contributed code is
placed under the org.jdom.contrib package hierarchy.  Currently we have
org.jdom.contrib.{beans,input,output,xpath,xslt}.  "beans" holds JDOMBean and
can hold related bean work.  "input" and "output" hold builders and
outputters.  "xpath" is a holder for the XPath library, and "xslt" is a holder
for an XSLT library.  If you have an interesting contribution, or just ideas
that someone else might pick up on, post to jdom-interest.

Building instructions
=====================

Building jdom-test is the same as building jdom.  See the README.txt in the
jdom module.
