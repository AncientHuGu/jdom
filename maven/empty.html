		<H1>JDOM Placeholder Javadoc</H1>
		This is a placeholder docment to satisfy the OSS requirements of
		Maven-Central: <I>OSS Projects must include Javadoc and Source artifacts</I>.
		<P>
		The reality is that the JavaDoc for the JUnit test cases would be odd to
		say the least, and the JDOM Contrib repositories are woefully out of
		date and inadequate.
		<P>
		In each case reading the source code is a much better idea, and is what
		you would need to do anyway. Even though this JavaDoc artifact is just a
		placeholder, the sources artifact is complete, and should be used as a
		(better) alternative.
		<P>
		The core JDOM jar though has comprehensive JavaDocs, and both the Source
		and JavaDoc artifacts are fully populated (unlike this...).
